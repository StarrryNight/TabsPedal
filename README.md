# TabsPedal
I play guitar and piano, and I hate to stop my playing and flip scores/tabs. Im developing this python program that can connect to food pedal, so page flipping can be done without halting my instrument playing. 
The main structure of the application is built by tkinter. I also used pypdf2 and tkPDFViewer for pdf maneuvers, like resizing. OpenCV will probably be used for the video page.
You can click "next page" button by clicking the right arrow key. Bind your footpedal to the right arrowkey so it can be accessible without your hands
